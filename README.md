## Overview

OKMemes is a fun and interactive web application created as part of my coding academy web development bootcamp. Built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project utilizes the power of HTML canvas to enable users to create customized memes. The user-friendly interface allows you to easily change text, add emojis, and customize your meme to suit your sense of humor. Additionally, you can download the generated meme directly to your local PC.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML:** The backbone of the project, providing structure and content.
- **CSS:** Styling the application to create an engaging user interface.
- **JavaScript:** Bringing interactivity and dynamic functionality to the memes.
- **HTML Canvas:** Leveraging canvas to enable users to create and customize their memes.
